# Computational Robotics Localization

You should include a couple of bag files of your code in action. Place the bag files in a subdirectory of your ROS package called “bags”. In this folder, create a README file that explains each of the bag files (how they were collected, what you take from the results, etc.).

Writeup (Due 10-12)

In your ROS package create a README.md file to hold your project writeup. Your writeup should touch on the following topics. We expect this writeup to be done in such a way that you are proud to include it as part of your professional portfolio. As such, please make sure to write the report so that it is understandable to an external audience. Make sure to add pictures to your report, links to Youtube videos, embedded animated Gifs (these can be recorded with the tool peek).

# Goals
What was the goal of your project?

# How did you solve the problem? 
How did you solve the problem? (Note: this doesn’t have to be super-detailed, you should try to explain what you did at a high-level so that others in the class could reasonably understand what you did).

# Design Decision
Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.

# Challenges
What if any challenges did you face along the way?

# Improve if we had more time
What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?

# Interesting lessons
Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.
